# 🧠 Awesome AI & ML Projects

Welcome to my collection of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning projects! This repository contains various projects I've developed to explore different algorithms, models, and applications within the AI/ML domain.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction System

This project is a **machine learning-based regression system** that predicts crop yield based on various environmental and agricultural features. It leverages data such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide use, country, and crop type to forecast the expected crop yield.

## 📌 Project Type

- **Supervised Machine Learning**
- **Regression Problem**

In supervised learning, regression problems are those where the output variable is a continuous numerical value. Since our dataset contains numerical yield values, this project fits into the regression category.

## 🛠 Features and Technologies

- **Python**
- **Flask** (Web framework)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** (Data processing and ML)
- **HTML5 + Bootstrap + CSS** (Frontend UI)

### Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Lasso
- Ridge
- K-Neighbors Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
