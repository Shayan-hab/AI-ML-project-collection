# 🧠 Awesome AI & ML Projects

Welcome to my collection of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning projects! This repository contains various projects I've developed to explore different algorithms, models, and applications within the AI/ML domain.

## 📁 Projects Included

# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction System

This project is a **machine learning-based regression system** that predicts crop yield based on various environmental and agricultural features. It leverages data such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide use, country, and crop type to forecast the expected crop yield.

## 📌 Project Type

- **Supervised Machine Learning**
- **Regression Problem**

In supervised learning, regression problems are those where the output variable is a continuous numerical value. Since our dataset contains numerical yield values, this project fits into the regression category.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- The dataset includes data from **101 countries**.
- It contains various features like:
  - Year
  - Average rainfall (mm/year)
  - Pesticide usage (tonnes)
  - Average temperature (°C)
  - Country/Region (Area)
  - Crop Type (Item)
  - Yield (target/output)

### 🌿 Crop Types in Dataset

The system supports prediction for the following crops:

- Maize (مکئی)
- Rice, paddy
- Potato
- Sorghum (جوار)
- Soybeans (سویابین)
- Wheat
- Cassava
- *(And others if available)*
